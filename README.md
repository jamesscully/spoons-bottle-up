# Bottle Up
An application created for use in restocking fridges behind the bar. Predominantly used to save time writing each individual bottle-name and count on a piece of paper, which is easily lost.

## Features

* **Easy to count** - use +/- buttons or step (++/--) in a specified amount
* **Inverted counting** - count how many bottles are present, get the amount needed
* **Organizable fridge list** - drag and drop bottles if their order is changed

## Installation
You can either clone this repository and run the following in the root:
``./gradlew assembleDebug``

You'll then find the compiled .apk at ``app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk``
